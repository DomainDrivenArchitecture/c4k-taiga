## Purpose

Easily generate a config for a small scale Taiga deployment. Complete with initial super user and configurable values for flexibility.

## Status

WIP. We are currently testing the ins and outs of our configuration.

## Try out

Click on the image to try out live in your browser:

[![Try it out](doc/tryItOut.png "Try out yourself")](https://domaindrivenarchitecture.org/pages/dda-provision/c4k-taiga/)

Your input will stay in your browser. No server interaction is required.

## Usage

You need:

* A working DNS route to the FQDN of your taiga installation
* A kubernetes cluster provisioned by [provs]
* The .yaml file generated by c4k-taiga

Apply this file on your cluster with `kubectl apply -f yourApp.yaml`.  
Done.

## Backup

For a working backup you need to save Taiga DB & Taiga Media as described here:
https://docs.taiga.io/backup-and-restore.html
